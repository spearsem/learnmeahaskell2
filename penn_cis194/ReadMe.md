A repo to hold notes, scratch work, and assignment solutions for the [Penn CIS 194 online course about Haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html).

All of the lecture files, homework assignment files, and any of the source code that is provided by the course site are all solely the work and property of the course creators. Posting these materials here is merely a convenience and in no way is meant to suggest that I have authorship of any materials here except for my own provided notes and solution files. 

This repo has no license -- feel free to take the code for any purpose. But please don't copy code from here and submit it as if it were your own solution for any type of course. Also, please note that I cannot speak about any licensing restrictions for the course materials themselves. For that you'll need to contact the course authors.
